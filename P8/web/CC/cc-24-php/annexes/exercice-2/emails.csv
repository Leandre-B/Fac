Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree:Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.)We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th.Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.Happy Holidays!----The Enron Elves Team----==============For your reference, below is some information about our adopted children:The Roberts ChildrenSelena (9 year-old girl)Sam (5 year-old boy)The Zurita ChildrenFelipe (13 year-old boy)Carolina (8 year-old girl)Kimberly (5 year-old girl)The Pruitt ChildrenLaveria (3 year-old girl)Deltric (11 month-old boy)"

To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.Firm						RelationshipBankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)Creditors' CommitteeU.S. TrusteeErnst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's CommitteeHoulihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' CommitteeBlackstone					Financial advisors for EnronBatchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for EnronWeil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for EnronMilbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' CommitteeAndrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron CorpThe following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:Ray Bowen - ChairmanBob ButtsJim FallonDave GlassfordDave GorteMark MullerJulia MurrayLou StolerInitially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.

2001-12-18 19:11:58-08:00,chairman.enron@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,,,Organizational Announcement,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.Organizational MattersThe Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.Personnel MattersAs a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.Office of the Chairman - Enron CorpJeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.Treasurer - Enron CorpRay Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.Corporate DevelopmentMark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.Wholesale ServicesThe Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.Management Committee DeparturesUnfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:Michael BrownMark FrevertSteve KeanMike McConnellJeff ShankmanAdditionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."

2001-12-07 17:11:26-08:00,chairman.enron@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,,,Update,"To Enron Employees:We want to take this opportunity to update all current employees of our ongoing plans for bringing our company out of bankruptcy.First, to be clear, there are valuable businesses at Enron. We intend to restructure the company and emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy, albeit smaller, company.In evaluating each Enron business or asset, we have been asking ourselves two key questions: ""Is the business or asset more valuable to the creditors as a going concern that generates positive cash flow, or is it more valuable being sold and turned into cash?""We have completed our preliminary analysis and have concluded that the majority of the U.S. assets are more valuable as a going concern.  These include pipelines, power stations and oil and gas properties to name a few.  Many of our emerging market assets are not generating adequate cash and, thus, may be more valuable being sold and turned into cash.The wholesale trading operation is clearly only valuable with a strong balance sheet behind it.  Unfortunately, Enron does not currently have a strong balance sheet.  Therefore, we are negotiating a transaction whereby Enron would contribute this business to a third party joint venture with a high credit rating while retaining a residual interest in its profit stream.  We believe this is the best alternative to preserve the value of the wholesale business and maintain a cash flow for the remaining businesses of Enron.We know that everyone is concerned about the recent retention payments made to certain employees.  Let me try to explain our rationale.  As you know, Enron is an intellectual capital business.  Without key people, we go into liquidation.  The wholesale natural gas and power business has been the most profitable business at Enron for the past several years.  It was this business that Dynegy was most interested in acquiring.  Therefore, in early November as the proposed merger was being negotiated, approximately 75 employees related to this business received retention bonuses.  These retention bonuses were paid to employees that were essential to the ultimate success of the merger.Last week, we took the additional step, related specifically to our bankruptcy filing, of offering payments to approximately 500 employees who are critical to operate our company. These payments came with the condition that the employees receiving such payments stay employed at Enron for a period of at least 90 days.   Seventy-five percent of employees who received these payments were below the vice president level.  The payments must be repaid, with a significant penalty, if the employee leaves the company early.  With these people in place, these businesses have substantially greater value, which will enhance our ability to pay creditors and provide the greatest benefit to all of Enron stakeholders.The next step will be for us to work with creditors to agree to a retention plan strategy for the remaining employees.  The goal is for this program to provide you with an incentive for you to stay with us while we work our way out of Chapter 11.  We also intend to see if we can work with creditors to develop more generous severance for current employees who involuntarily lose their jobs in the future.This is an extraordinarily difficult time for all of us at Enron. With the constraints of bankruptcy and the deluge of reports from the media, it is difficult for any employee to feel certain of our situation. However, our previous and near-term actions are intended to preserve as much of the value of our businesses as possible so that we remain a viable company both in the short and long term.Thank you for your patience, your understanding and your continuing hard work and contributions.Office of the Chairman"

Calpine held another call Tuesday -- with the>stated aim of discussing talks to renegotiate power sale contracts with>the state of California -- and spent more than three hours responding to a>range of issues raised by concerned holders and snarky critics.>>>>But soon after this marathon gabfest got under way, Calpine stock, already>down for the day, plummeted after a series of remarks by executives that>the market didn't like. It ended the day down 13% at $15.50, a 52-week low.>>If Detox had to make a list of why the market biffed Calpine during the>call, these would be the reasons:>>1. Dilution. Calpine executives said they would be willing to issue stock>at a low price if cash were needed, and if debt couldn't be issued because>it would push the leverage ratio above acceptable levels. (Leverage is>here defined as debt to total capital, while capital is debt plus equity>and equitylike securities.) The executives didn't say an equity issue was>imminent or probable. However, the fact that an offering could be done at>a low stock price would make it dilutive for existing shareholders. A big>negative. To raise $1 billion at Tuesday's stock price, Calpine would have>to issue about 65 million shares, equivalent to 20% of its shares>outstanding at the end of the third quarter. Notably, Calpine executives>said that they probably wouldn't use an equity issue to pay back a $1>billion convertible bond that may need refinancing in April.>>2. Natural gas assets. Calpine said it could, if it had to, raise $1>billion from ""monetizing"" its natural gas reserves. That would provide the>company with cash, but it would put an up-to-date price on the assets that>could be well below what Calpine recently paid for them. That might force>the company to do a big writedown to equity, which would, in turn, damage>leverage ratios. On the call, Calpine executives played down the notion>that they may have to do a writedown, saying future gas prices suggest one>isn't necessary.>>Related Stories>Calpine Holders Cringe as Cash Questions Swirl>Calpine Offers Cold Comfort>Calpine Offers Its Side of the Story>How Enron Came Undone>Dynegy Dives as Enron Won't Go Quietly>>>3. Earnings outlook. Not only did the company say it may have to revise>2002 earnings guidance, but it also showed uncertainty about>fourth-quarter 2001 earnings. This looks bad for three reasons. First, it>suggests that Calpine has more of its business unhedged than investors>have believed, leaving the company vulnerable to the slump in power>prices. Second, it will add weight to the argument that a glut of power>generation capacity is building. Third, and critically for investors>looking for a bottom in Calpine stock, a large cut in the 2002 earnings>outlook could make the stock look a lot pricier than it is at multiples>based on current Street estimates. Analysts currently expect Calpine to>make $2.52 a share in 2002, putting the stock on a bargain-basement>price-earnings ratio of 6 to 1. But if earnings were to be half that, the>P/E would obviously double to 12, which would actually be quite expensive>for a company that faces liquidity constraints that could force it to>jettison its growth strategy. If Calpine continues to struggle to clear>its name, a floor for its stock price may be book value, currently $9 ashare.>>4. Renegotiating California contracts. Although this was the ostensible>subject of the call, too little was said on this issue. The company gave>no indication of how much business might be at stake and was reluctant to>surmise on how much of a hit it might take from recasting the forward gas>purchases made to fuel the power production.>>5. Accounting issues remain. Calpine revealed on the call that it uses it>own in-house method to calculate its leverage. This unorthodox method,>which adds $700 million paid for a Canadian gas company to equity, makes>the company's leverage ratio look lower than it actually is. At one point>on the call, a Calpine executive couldn't detail what was added to net>income to get to the company's earnings before interest, taxes,>depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) number. This is pertinent because>SEC Insight, a research firm that reviews internal Securities and Exchange>Commission documents, said in a report Tuesday that the SEC had talked>with Calpine about the way it presents its EBITDA number in its SEC-filed>financials.>>6. Bank loans and liquidity. Much time was spent addressing whether>Calpine can increase the size of a corporate revolving loan to $1.5>billion from $400 million. The company said it thought it could do this in>early January. But banks that have gotten burned by lending to Enron>(ENE:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) may now be scaling>back their energy exposure. What's more, Calpine is trying to raise the>size of a corporate loan, implying that the funds aren't needed primarily>for construction purposes. Could the need for new cash have arisen within>the company's trading operations? Calpine said Tuesday that its>counterparties weren't asking for more collateral. But if the trading desk>is consuming more, then it's even more unlikely that the banks will>increase their credit line, considering the Enron meltdown.</x-flowed>"

The new fees are as follows:1-100mw's=$3 fee100-200mw's=$4 feeover 200mw=$5 feePlease note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.  Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.  In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.thanks,ryan"

Our division just got bought out by the Union Bank of Switzerland, or better known as UBS.  I guess things didn't work out so well for most with the company, but what are you gonna do.  Right now it's 6am and I am the only one here.  About 75% of our portland office got laid off.  I'm in early to read my new contract with UBS, I think I'm going to sign it which means I'll be here for another year at least.  I should end up getting a new UBS email address soon, also my hotmail account is a good address, rmsling@hotmail.com	So when are you up in Portland?  It was two years ago january since I've seen you!  Hope everthing is going well.ryan-----Original Message-----From: 9099632747@airmessage.net [mailto:9099632747@airmessage.net]Sent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 4:34 PMTo: Slinger, RyanSubject: Message from a two-way deviceFWD: hey ry-man! how's tricks? all is on the well-ish tip w/me, um...i hate to be the ba-zillionth person to ask, but what is your story re: employment now? funny thing...rick waddell-enron VP in houston was a co-chair for the round table i was on at a foreign policy conference up at west point during the week preceeding enron's public announcement. actually, the conference ended that very day- all quite interesting...:) anyhow, hope you get this. i will wait to hear that you are still recieving email at this address before i blab on much more. ah! i do look forward to hearing from you and hope all is wund-a-mous w/youse. misses! kelly (mcintyre)"

2001-07-13 01:37:15-07:00,ryan.slinger@enron.com,shift.portland@enron.com,,,Deals for 7/12/01,"1.  When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier."
